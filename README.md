# Scalable Deep Compressive Sensing 

# paper abstract

Deep learning has been used to image compressive sensing (CS) for enhanced reconstruction performance. However, most existing deep learning methods train different models for different subsampling ratios, which brings an additional hardware burden. In this paper, we develop a general framework named scalable deep compressive sensing (SDCS) for the scalable sampling and reconstruction (SSR) of all existing end-to-end-trained models. In the proposed way, images are measured and initialized linearly. Two sampling matrix masks are introduced to flexibly control the subsampling ratios used in sampling and reconstruction, respectively. To achieve a reconstruction model with flexible subsampling ratios, a training strategy dubbed scalable training is developed. In scalable training, the model is trained with the sampling matrix and the initialization matrix at various subsampling ratios by integrating different sampling matrix masks. Experimental results show that models with SDCS can achieve SSR without changing their structure while maintaining good performance, and SDCS outperforms other SSR methods.
